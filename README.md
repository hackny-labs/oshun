# oshun

## Idea
Write a Firefox/Chrome extension that helps students (or just normal people) internalize the content they read (either online textbooks, papers, or articles) by automatically generating a list of questions about the text that the user will ideally attempt to answer after they have finished reading the text.

## To test locally:
1. Clone this repo locally.
2. Navigate to Chrome -> Settings -> Extensions
3. Load unpacked extension...
4. Open the /oshun/chrome folder
